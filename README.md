# Simulation
## 1. Estimating the value of Pi using Monte Carlo
The idea is to simulate random (x, y) points in a 2-D plane with domain as a square of side 2r units centered on (0,0). Imagine a circle inside the same domain with same radius r and inscribed into the square. We then calculate the ratio of number points that lied inside the circle and total number of generated points - [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/)
